I am a PhD student at the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.stat.unipd.it/en/) of [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/), where I am supervised by Prof. [Bruno Scarpa](https://homes.stat.unipd.it/brunoscarpa). 

I am currently a visiting graduate student at the [Department of Stastical Science]() of Duke University, working with Prof. [David Dunson](https://www.daviddunson.com/) and Prof. Prof. [Tommaso Rigon](https://tommasorigon.github.io).

I am a silent guy, but I can speak for days about sports and mountains.
