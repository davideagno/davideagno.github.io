I am a Postdoctoral associate at the Department of Statistical Science of Duke University, where I work with David Dunson and Amy Herring.

Typically silent, but I can speak for days about sports and [mountains](https://maphub.net/davide_agnoletto/escursioni).

See my full CV [here](/files/CURRICULUM.pdf).
