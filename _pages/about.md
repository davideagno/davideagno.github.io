I am a Postdoctoral associate at the Department of Statistical Science of Duke University, where I work with David Dunson.

I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of Padova, under the supervision of Bruno Scarpa, Tommaso Rigon and David Dunson.

Outside Statistics, I love [trekking](https://maphub.net/davide_agnoletto/escursioni) and talking about sports.

See my (not always) up-to-date CV [here](/files/CV.pdf).
